description: The file format for uncompiled Source2 maps.
title: VMAP
---

.vmap is the file format for uncompiled Source2 maps when they are being edited in [Hammer](../../EngineTools/HammerEditor/index.mdx).

It is a [DMX](../dmx.md) file under binary encoding version 4, [Hammer](../../EngineTools/HammerEditor/index.mdx) can export a plain text version if you go to `File -> Save Copy As Text`

:::info
<Tool name="s2v"/> can decompile compiled maps (.vmap_c usually contained within a VPK) into a .vmap\
<Tool name="github" suffix="Datamodel.NET" link="https://github.com/kristiker/Datamodel.NET"/> can be used to read and write kv2 files including vmaps, using C#.

An implemented version of the vmap format as described here can be found in the source code of <Tool name="github" suffix="VRF (s2v)" link="https://github.com/ValveResourceFormat/ValveResourceFormat/blob/master/ValveResourceFormat/IO/ContentFormats/ValveMap.cs"/>, used for vmap_c decompilation.
:::

## Vmap example

The following is a simple vmap in plain text format from <Game name="cs2" /> consisting of a hammer mesh and an entity.

:::info
The Root of a vmap DMX file is `CMapRootElement`\
In the text encoding of DMX, when an Element is only referenced once, it will be directly inserted as a value of the property that references it, when it's referenced multiple times, it will be extracted and put into the Root element, and everything referencing it will reference its UUID.
:::

[Vmap example](./example.vmap.mdx) (external page due to the large size)

## Vmap file structure

A list of vmap DMX nodes can be found below, this list is based on a <Game name="cs2" /> version 40 vmap.

Annoyingly the [naming convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)) of attributes in vmaps is all over the place, some of the cases used include:
- flatcase
- camelCase
- PascalCase
- snake_case
- `m_` member variable notation

:::todo
Would be nice to have info on which nodes exists in what vmap version, and possibly even game specific vmap nodes.
:::

### DMElement

Not a vmap node, but the base DataModel element that every other node inherits from, All nodes have these properties.

```json
"id" "elementid" "53f14a8f-0ac6-4fba-a836-7d85d70bf641"
```
- id \<`elementid`\>\
A UUID V4 ID used to refer to this node.

### CMapRootElement

This is the main element of the vmap, it contains a few map specific properties and helper objects, and the main "world" object. All Elements which are referenced more than once will be put inside of this Root node.

```json
"CMapRootElement"
{
	"isprefab" "bool" "0"
	"editorbuild" "int" "10533"
	"editorversion" "int" "400"
	"itemFile" "string" ""

	"defaultcamera" "CStoredCamera"
	"3dcameras" "CStoredCameras"
	
	"world" "CMapWorld" 
	"visbility" "CVisibilityMgr"
	
	"mapVariables" "CMapVariableSet"

- world \<`CMapWorld`\>\
An Element containing Elements or referenced to Elements which make up the map like entities, meshes, etc..

- visbility \<`CVisibilityMgr`\>\
Yes you read that right, this Element is hilariously misspelled as `visbility` instead of `visibility`. It keeps track of what is hidden in the map, from quick hide, selection sets, etc..

- mapVariables \<`CMapVariableSet`\>\
Map variables, they can be set in the `Map -> MapProperties -> Map Variables` tab.

- rootSelectionSet \<[CMapSelectionSet](#cmapselectionset)\>\

- m_bCordonsVisible \<`bool`\>\
If the cordon tool is visible.

- nodeInstanceData \<`element_array`\>\
Per node instance data for things like hammer preview lighting

### MapNode

This is not a real vmap node, but most nodes have these properties so it seems like a likely base class.

```json
"MapNode"
{
	"id" "elementid" "53f14a8f-0ac6-4fba-a836-7d85d70bf641"
	"nodeID" "int" "1"
	"referenceID" "uint64" "0x0"
	"children" "element_array"

	"variableTargetKeys" "string_array" 
	"variableNames" "string_array" 

	"origin" "vector3" "0 0 0"
	"angles" "qangle" "0 0 0"
	"scales" "vector3" "1 1 1"

	"transformLocked" "bool" "0"

}
```
- nodeID \<`int`\>\
The ID of this node, can be seen in Hammer in the Outliner.

- referenceID \<`uint64`\>\
Unknown, but seems to be some sort of pointer however Hammer will load maps just fine with this always being 0.

- children \<`element_array`\>\
All the children of this node, they can be other nodes directly (when the node only exists once) or UUID references to other nodes 

- variableTargetKeys \<`string_array`\>\
variableNames \<`string_array`\>\
Both seem to be related to the map variable system, possibly when a property of a node is using a map variable.

- origin \<`vector3`\>\
The origin of the node in Hammer units.

- angles \<`qangle`\>\
The angles of the node in euler angles.

- scales \<`vector3`\>\

- transformLocked \<`bool`\>\
If true, stops the origin, angles or scales of this object from being changed in Hammer, the option to toggle this in the UI shows in the Transform group in `Object Properties`

- force_hidden \<`bool`\>\
If true it will force this object to not be visibile to VIS, shown in the Visibility group in `Object Properties`

- editorOnly \<`bool`\>\
If true it will force this object to not be compiled into the map, useful for developer only messages, shown in the Visibility group in `Object Properties`

- customVisGroup \<`string`\>\
Will add a custom Vis group in the `Auto Vis Groups` panel, this object will show under it, useful for organisation. Shown in the Visibility group in `Object Properties`

### BaseEntity
#### Inherits from [MapNode](#mapnode)

This is not a real vmap node, but [CMapEntity](#cmapentity), [CMapWorld](#cmapworld) and [CMapInstance](#cmapinstance) share these properties so this seems like a likely base class.

```json
"relayPlugData" "DmePlugList" ""

### EditGameClassProps

A string -> string dictionary storing entity keyvalues, seems to just be a standard kv2 element, which can act as a string dictionary. 


### CMapWorld
#### Inherits from [BaseEntity](#baseentity) -> [MapNode](#mapnode)

This is the main element that contains everything in the vmap, its also the entity you edit when you change properties in `Map -> Map Properties`, it becomes the `worldspawn` entity at runtime.

```json
"world" "CMapWorld"
{
	"id" "elementid" "53f14a8f-0ac6-4fba-a836-7d85d70bf641"

	"children" "element_array"

	"variableTargetKeys" "string_array"

```

- children \<`element_array`\>\
The children of CMapWorld are everything contained in the map, in the text encoding of DMX if a node is referenced only once, its inserted directly, if it is referenced more than once, it will be put into the Root element, in this case [CMapRootElement](#cmaprootelement) and it will be referenced by its UUID.

- nextDecalID \<`int`\>\
Unknown.

- fixupEntityNames \<`bool`\>\
Unknown. Prefabs have this option in order to prevent name collisions, why would the main VMAP need this tho?

- mapUsageType \<`string`\>\
	The type of the map.

	- standard\
		For normal maps.

	- background\
		For CS2 background UI maps. 

	- skybox\
		For 3D skyboxes.

	The position of the camera.

- lookat \<`vector3`\>\
	This is the origin offset by one unit along the look vector.

### CStoredCameras

	"selectedObjects" "element_array" 
}
```

- name \<`string`\>\

}
```

- target \<`element`\>\
	Unknown.

- variableOverrideNames \<`string_array`\>\
	Unknown.

- variableOverrideValues \<`string_array`\>\
	Unknown.

- targetMapPath \<`string`\>\
	The map to load.

- fixupEntityNames \<`bool`\>\
	If enabled, any entity target names within the prefab will have a prefix applied to ensure they are unique. This prevents any issues with entities in two different prefabs having name collisions.

- useTargetNameAsPrefix \<`bool`\>\
	If this is enabled and name fixup is enabled, the prefix used for name fixup will be the prefab target name instead of the unique id. If the target name is empty then the prefab the unique id will still be used as the prefix. Note that if two prefabs use the same target name for their prefix it will be possible to have entities inside the prefabs end up with name collisions.

- loadIfNested \<`bool`\>\
	If enabled the prefab will be loaded when it is the child of another prefab, if disabled, this prefab will not be loaded if it is the child of another prefab.

- prefabRuntimeEntity \<`bool`\>\
	Unknown.

- loadAtRuntime \<`bool`\>\
	If enabled the prefab will not be baked into the parent map during map compile, but instead will be dynamically loaded in the game. This requires the target map to be compiled separately. Additionally this requires support for dynamic loading of maps by the game, which may not be supported by all games and game systems. Do not use without checking to see if this is fully supported by the game you are working on.

### CMapInstance
