description: The file format for uncompiled Source2 maps.
title: VMAP
---

.vmap is the file format for uncompiled Source2 maps when they are being edited in [Hammer](../../EngineTools/HammerEditor/index.mdx).

It is a [DMX](../dmx.md) file under binary encoding version 4, [Hammer](../../EngineTools/HammerEditor/index.mdx) can export a plain text version if you go to `File -> Save Copy As Text`

:::info
<Tool name="s2v"/> can decompile compiled maps (.vmap_c usually contained within a VPK) into a .vmap\
<Tool name="github" suffix="Datamodel.NET" link="https://github.com/kristiker/Datamodel.NET"/> can be used to read and write kv2 files including vmaps, using C#.

An implemented version of the vmap format as described here can be found in the source code of <Tool name="github" suffix="VRF (s2v)" link="https://github.com/ValveResourceFormat/ValveResourceFormat/blob/master/ValveResourceFormat/IO/ContentFormats/ValveMap.cs"/>, used for vmap_c decompilation.
:::

## Vmap example

The following is a simple vmap in plain text format from <Game name="cs2" /> consisting of a hammer mesh and an entity.

:::info
The Root of a vmap DMX file is `CMapRootElement`\
In the text encoding of DMX, when an Element is only referenced once, it will be directly inserted as a value of the property that references it, when it's referenced multiple times, it will be extracted and put into the Root element, and everything referencing it will reference its UUID.
:::

[Vmap example](./example.vmap.mdx) (external page due to the large size)

## Vmap file structure

A list of vmap DMX nodes can be found below, this list is based on a <Game name="cs2" /> version 40 vmap.

Annoyingly the [naming convention](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naming_convention_(programming)) of attributes in vmaps is all over the place, some of the cases used include:
- flatcase
- camelCase
- PascalCase
- snake_case
- `m_` member variable notation

:::todo
Would be nice to have info on which nodes exists in what vmap version, and possibly even game specific vmap nodes.
:::

### DMElement

Not a vmap node, but the base DataModel element that every other node inherits from, All nodes have these properties.

```json
"id" "elementid" "53f14a8f-0ac6-4fba-a836-7d85d70bf641"
```
- id \<`elementid`\>\
A UUID V4 ID used to refer to this node.

### CMapRootElement

This is the main element of the vmap, it contains a few map specific properties and helper objects, and the main "world" object. All Elements which are referenced more than once will be put inside of this Root node.

```json
"CMapRootElement"
{
	"isprefab" "bool" "0"
	"editorbuild" "int" "10533"
	"editorversion" "int" "400"
	"itemFile" "string" ""

	"defaultcamera" "CStoredCamera"
	"3dcameras" "CStoredCameras"
	
	"world" "CMapWorld" 
	"visbility" "CVisibilityMgr"
	
	"mapVariables" "CMapVariableSet"

	"rootSelectionSet" "CMapSelectionSet"
	
	"m_ReferencedMeshSnapshots" "element_array" 
	[
	]

	"m_bIsCordoning" "bool" "0"
	"m_bCordonsVisible" "bool" "0"

	"nodeInstanceData" "element_array" 
	[
	]
}
```

- isprefab \<`bool`\>\
If the map is a prefab or not.

- editorbuild \<`int`\>\
The build number that you can view in `Help -> About`.

- editorversion \<`int`\>\
Unknown.

- itemFile \<`string`\>\
Unknown.

- defaultcamera \<`[CStoredCamera](#cstoredcamera)`\>\
The default editor camera.

- 3dcameras \<`[CStoredCameras](#cstoredcameras)`\>\
A list of other editor cameras.

- world \<`CMapWorld`\>\
An Element containing Elements or referenced to Elements which make up the map like entities, meshes, etc..

- visbility \<`CVisibilityMgr`\>\
Yes you read that right, this Element is hilariously misspelled as `visbility` instead of `visibility`. It keeps track of what is hidden in the map, from quick hide, selection sets, etc..

- mapVariables \<`CMapVariableSet`\>\
Map variables, they can be set in the `Map -> MapProperties -> Map Variables` tab.

- rootSelectionSet \<[CMapSelectionSet](#cmapselectionset)\>\
A hidden selection set which contains all other selection sets.

- m_ReferencedMeshSnapshots \<`element_array`\>\
Mesh snapshots referenced by this map.

- m_bIsCordoning \<`bool`\>\
If the cordon tool is active.

- m_bCordonsVisible \<`bool`\>\
If the cordon tool is visible.

- nodeInstanceData \<`element_array`\>\
Per node instance data for things like hammer preview lighting

### MapNode

This is not a real vmap node, but most nodes have these properties so it seems like a likely base class.

```json
"MapNode"
{
	"id" "elementid" "53f14a8f-0ac6-4fba-a836-7d85d70bf641"
	"nodeID" "int" "1"
	"referenceID" "uint64" "0x0"
	"children" "element_array"

	"variableTargetKeys" "string_array" 
	"variableNames" "string_array" 

	"origin" "vector3" "0 0 0"
	"angles" "qangle" "0 0 0"
	"scales" "vector3" "1 1 1"

	"transformLocked" "bool" "0"
	"force_hidden" "bool" "0"
	"editorOnly" "bool" "0"
	"customVisGroup" "string" ""
}
```
- nodeID \<`int`\>\
The ID of this node, can be seen in Hammer in the Outliner.

- referenceID \<`uint64`\>\
Unknown, but seems to be some sort of pointer however Hammer will load maps just fine with this always being 0.

- children \<`element_array`\>\
All the children of this node, they can be other nodes directly (when the node only exists once) or UUID references to other nodes 

- variableTargetKeys \<`string_array`\>\
variableNames \<`string_array`\>\
Both seem to be related to the map variable system, possibly when a property of a node is using a map variable.

- origin \<`vector3`\>\
The origin of the node in Hammer units.

- angles \<`qangle`\>\
The angles of the node in euler angles.

- scales \<`vector3`\>\
The scales of the node.

- transformLocked \<`bool`\>\
If true, stops the origin, angles or scales of this object from being changed in Hammer, the option to toggle this in the UI shows in the Transform group in `Object Properties`

- force_hidden \<`bool`\>\
If true it will force this object to not be visibile to VIS, shown in the Visibility group in `Object Properties`

- editorOnly \<`bool`\>\
If true it will force this object to not be compiled into the map, useful for developer only messages, shown in the Visibility group in `Object Properties`

- customVisGroup \<`string`\>\
Will add a custom Vis group in the `Auto Vis Groups` panel, this object will show under it, useful for organisation. Shown in the Visibility group in `Object Properties`

### BaseEntity
#### Inherits from [MapNode](#mapnode)

This is not a real vmap node, but [CMapEntity](#cmapentity), [CMapWorld](#cmapworld) and [CMapInstance](#cmapinstance) share these properties so this seems like a likely base class.

```json
"relayPlugData" "DmePlugList" ""
"connectionsData" "element_array" ""
"entity_properties" "EditGameClassProps" ""
```

- relayPlugData \<[DmePlugList](#dmepluglist)\>\
Unknown.

	"outputName" "string" "OnUser1"
	"targetType" "int" "7"
	"targetName" "string" "!self"
	"inputName" "string" "FireUser1"

### EditGameClassProps

A string -> string dictionary storing entity keyvalues, seems to just be a standard kv2 element, which can act as a string dictionary. 


### CMapWorld
#### Inherits from [BaseEntity](#baseentity) -> [MapNode](#mapnode)

This is the main element that contains everything in the vmap, its also the entity you edit when you change properties in `Map -> Map Properties`, it becomes the `worldspawn` entity at runtime.

```json
"world" "CMapWorld"
{
	"id" "elementid" "53f14a8f-0ac6-4fba-a836-7d85d70bf641"

	"children" "element_array"

	"variableTargetKeys" "string_array" 
	"variableNames" "string_array" 
	"relayPlugData" "DmePlugList"
	"connectionsData" "element_array" 
	"nextDecalID" "int" "0"
	"fixupEntityNames" "bool" "1"
	"mapUsageType" "string" "standard"
	"origin" "vector3" "0 0 0"
	"angles" "qangle" "0 0 0"
	"scales" "vector3" "1 1 1"
	"transformLocked" "bool" "0"
	"force_hidden" "bool" "0"
	"editorOnly" "bool" "0"
	"customVisGroup" "string" ""

	"entity_properties" "EditGameClassProps"
}
```

- children \<`element_array`\>\
The children of CMapWorld are everything contained in the map, in the text encoding of DMX if a node is referenced only once, its inserted directly, if it is referenced more than once, it will be put into the Root element, in this case [CMapRootElement](cmaprootelement) and it will be referenced by its UUID.

- nextDecalID \<`int`\>\
Unknown.

- fixupEntityNames \<`bool`\>\
Unknown. Prefabs have this option in order to prevent name collisions, why would the main VMAP need this tho?

- mapUsageType \<`string`\>\
	The type of the map.

	- standard\
		For normal maps.

	- background\
		For CS2 background UI maps. 

	- skybox\
		For 3D skyboxes.

	- minigame\
		Unknown.

	- sharedenvironment\
		Unknown.

- randomSeed \<`int`\>\
	Unknown. Perhaps used for *something* that needs a random seed, but that, and why can you set it?

### CStoredCamera

An editor camera.

```json
"defaultcamera" "CStoredCamera"
{
	"id" "elementid" "53f14a8f-0ac6-4fba-a836-7d85d70bf641"
	"position" "vector3" "-291.7109680176 -261.1103210449 217.3533782959"
	"lookat" "vector3" "-291.8317871094 -260.2921142578 216.7912902832"
}
```
- position \<`vector3`\>\
	The position of the camera.

- lookat \<`vector3`\>\
	This is the origin offset by one unit along the look vector.

### CStoredCameras

The editor cameras stored in the vmap.

:::todo
When are multiple editor cameras stored in the vmap?
:::

```json
"3dcameras" "CStoredCameras"
{
	"id" "elementid" "21382dc1-34f4-4dc1-b017-0f431fddfdd5"
	"activecamera" "int" "-1"
	"cameras" "element_array" 
}
```

- activecamera \<`int`\>\
	The current active camera index.

- cameras \<`element_array`\>\
	An array of [CStoredCamera](#cstoredcamera) elements.

### CVisibilityMgr
#### Inherits from [MapNode](#mapnode)

Manages hiding nodes.

:::todo
Why is this a node? can you select this in Hammer somehow? It seems to always be at 0 0 0.
:::

```json
"visbility" "CVisibilityMgr"
{
	"id" "elementid" "ce0026f6-da81-41e3-9267-3d2bdadba660"

	"selectionSetData" "CObjectSelectionSetDataElement"
},
```
- children \<`element_array`\>\
	Selection sets can contain other selection sets, this is not selected objects, those are stored in selectionSetData.
