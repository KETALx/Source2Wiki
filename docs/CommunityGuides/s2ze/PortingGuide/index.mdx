title: Porting Guide

## Introduction

This porting guide provides useful information when porting a Zombie Escape map from CS:GO to CS2. It covers procedures to follow when porting the map, suggests workarounds for potential pitfalls, provides guidance on implementing new Source 2 features, and more.

Although this guide was written primarily for the Zombie Escape gamemode, it is versatile enough to be used and implemented for other gamemodes. Similarly, the guide can be useful for a general porting process from Source 1 to Source 2.

The wiki is set up in an order of recommended steps to take when porting a map from scratch, but it can be freely used as a wiki.
