description: How to get Static and Dynamic lighting from the light_environment in older Source 2 Games.  
title: light_environment in older Source 2 games  
---

This guide explains how in older Source 2 games like <Game name="hla"/> and <Game name="steamvr"/> you can have both static and dynamic (CSM) lighting from the `light_environment`.

:::info
Although in newer versions of the Source 2 engine (since 2020) the `light_environment` supports both static and dynamic at the same time in a single entity, this is not retroactive for older Source 2 versions.

:::info
It is highly recommended to name at least your dynamic `light_environment`, as in interior areas of the level you can disable it (by killing it) to save resources.
:::

Create your base `light_environment` entity. This first one is going to be static only (generates baked lighting). After you finish setting up the entity it should look something like this:  
![base light_environment](./stock_light_env_static.png "StockLightEnv")

Change the `Direct Lighting` label to be Static (a.k.a. Baked):  
![Static light_environment](./final_light_env_static.png "StaticLightEnv")  

---

Once you have done this, make a copy of the static `light_environment`. This will be our base for the dynamic `light_environment`, which will add CSM to the level.  
Change the `Render Specular` label to `off`, `Direct Lighting` to `Per-Pixel`, `Indirect Lighting` to `None`, and disable AO if it is enabled.  
It should look something like this:  
![Dynamic light_environment](./final_light_env_dynamic.png "DynamicLightEnv")

:::info
It is highly recommended that you reduce the brightness of the dynamic `light_environment`, as CSM not only add shadows but also brightness to the level. If not adjusted, this could result in an overbright environment.

# Example
The level [City-Oasis](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=3409720496) in SteamVR uses this technique. Here are a few images below:
